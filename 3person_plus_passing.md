# Non-manipulation patterns for 3 or more jugglers

## 3 jugglers

### 9-clubs

- **2-count 9-club feed** 
  - Var: Runaround (when the feeder changes - base pattern for Scramble-V)
- **pps 9-club feed**
  - Var: Runaround (the person who walks does a 4-count, the feeder does a 2-count with the same person that is not moving, the future feeder does sp (2-count) + psppspps...
- [Bruno's Nightmare (3-count version)](https://www.passingdb.com/patterns.php?id=48)  
A giant juggles 3 jugglers (2 do 6-count, one feeds in 3-count and they change
roles)

### 10 clubs
- **2-count 10-club feed**  
Var: Runaround (when the feeder changes - base pattern for Ample-V)
Feeder does a 2-count to the same person when the other juggler does the 
runaround part. The runaround can be: 3 slow selfs, 1 double self + 2 normal 
for example (you have to fill 5 bits of time in there :)

### 11 clubs
- **pps 10-club feed** (996 vs 2x966)  
Feeder: pps (out,out,in,in - like in the 9-club version), starts with 5 clubs. 
Feedes: 3-count, crossing.

## 4 jugglers

- Square placement, 2 jugglers work as **2-count feeders**, the 2 others do 
**4-count** as simple feedees
- **Shooting star** (single passes, one juggler runs to the extra corner of the 
pentagram)
- **Y** (2-count mostly, can be 4-count). Variations:
  - **Rotating Y**  
Always moving clockwise, both groups change position every n passes (2 or 3 
ususally), always pass and receive from the same juggler as before
  - Boxy-I Y (coolest variation of Y)  
US vs THEM, always moving clockwise, every n passes (2 or 3 usually) of 4-count 
ONLY one group changes position, at every moving one group (only) of jugglers 
changes the jugglers that they pass at, so generally you pass to both of the 
other group (but this is true only for one of the groups, the other does not 
change to whom they pass at). Each juggler in the group moves in a 
diamond-shaped path!
- **Phantoms** (nice and easy). Positioning:  
(Phantom) A B (Phantom)  
(Phantom) C D (Phantom)  
A pass to the phantom is  a pass to yourself! (or to some other person that 
might be coming there and fill in the 'phantom' position). Each juggler does 
a 2-count, windshield style. Example - D's throw sequence is: (Phantom), B, A, 
B, (Phantom), ...
- **Weaver**  
Feeder: 2-count and feeds like a windshield 3 people  
Feedes: 6-count and moving as a 3-people cascade

## 5 jugglers

- **2,3,4-count Star**  
  - Pentagram positiong
  - Throw to the person that's righty-next to the person that's right of you! 
  - In 3-count, throws are *outside*
- **Feast**  
  - Pentagram positioning, 4-count
  - Each time throw a pass to a different person's left hand (I mean do a 
4-count with different person each time, following the circle orientation) - 
find next person by going clockwise, start by throwing to the person on your left
  - Throw sequence could be vanilla, chocolate bar, banana and generally 
different kind of passes between each person (but have to be in a 4-count)
- **Hand-feast (nice)**  
  - Pentagram positioning, 4-count
  - Each time throw a pass to a different hand in the circle going clockwise,
when it is time to throw to your hands, 'throw' a self, feels like Jim's
- **5-count Star with doubles (and 16 clubs)**  
  - Pentagram positioning, 5-count
  - Double passes
  - 16 clubs (one person holds 4 clubs and starts throwing in the 1st beat)
  - In each beat a different person throws a double (5 beats in total)
  - Throw **crossing passes** to the same person (the same person you would throw
if you were doing a 4-count Star). Your right hand pass goes to his right hand,
etc.
