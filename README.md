# curated-siteswaps

A [Quarto book](https://bblodfon.github.io/curated-siteswaps/) where I keep track of my siteswaps, various juggling patterns and training programs that I have come up with related to my juggling practice.
Lots of passing patterns in there as well!

This is for **personal use**, though if others enjoy its benefits then all the better!
