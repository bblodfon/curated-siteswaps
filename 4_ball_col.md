# 4 ball siteswaps with coloring :)

The most interesting patterns visually seem to be having 2 colors, which can be distributed in the balls either as (2+2) - 2 balls <span style="color:red">red</span>, 2 balls <span style="color:blue">blue</span> - or (3+1) - 3 balls <span style="color:red">red</span>, 1 ball <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
So, we either search for patterns that 2 balls do something distinguished from the other 2, or 1 ball does something different from the other 3.

## 2+2

- <span style="color:red">55</span>2 vs <span style="color:red">5</span><span style="color:blue">5</span>2
- <span style="color:red">64</span>2 vs <span style="color:red">6</span><span style="color:blue">4</span>2 (the 2 balls in any hand have the same color)
- 561 (again 2 ways)

## 3+1

- 53444
- 46451
- 55514
