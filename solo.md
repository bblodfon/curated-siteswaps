# Solo Juggling Siteswaps

<p><i>
Last updated: September 27, 2021

Knowledge acquired throughout years of practicing, playing over and over 
siteswaps, trying to find pleasant and/or aesthetic pattern characteristics 
through the siteswap numbering system. This is a collection of what feels 
good for me, without taking the difficulty to the extreme levels (e.g. 7 
balls+).  
I also include specialized training regimes (again what worked for 
me best) and other miscellaneous stuff like mills mess and 3 ball patterns.

## Notes

- *Somewhere in 2020*: After 10 years of Juggling, I understood this: it's all about the *form*, siteswaps especially.
Also, **solidity of a siteswap/pattern** seems to hold a different meaning for each person but given 2 jugglers with different *solidity* everybody agrees to who is more solid!
Lastly, 7 still is too much (balls) and I really don't find numbers above 7 worth pursuing anymore in siteswaps (form gets loose and unasthetic).
Found more meaning in 3 and 4 ball tricks, using imagination and of course club juggling that epitomizes that.
- *March 2021*: I have started realizing that using different colored objects to juggle is a major improvement over the unicolor culture that I was familiar with.
The use of colors benefits your technique, it's more practical for learning new tricks, shows some hidden possibilities in your juggling exploiting a visual perspective, helps to build your own style and makes your mood better by adding an extra layer of diversity.
So, I highly recommend it!
