# Solo Juggling Siteswaps

Knowledge acquired throughout years of practicing, playing over and over 
siteswaps, trying to find pleasant and/or aesthetic pattern characteristics 
through the siteswap numbering system. This is a collection of what feels 
good for me, without taking the difficulty to the extreme levels (e.g. 7 
balls+).  
I also include specialized training regimes (again what worked for 
me best) and other miscellaneous stuff.
