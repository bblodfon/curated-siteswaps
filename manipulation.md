# Manipulation patterns

# 3-person

- 4-count Roundabout (standard)
- 3-count Roundabout (Nickie's version)
- Chopsticks (3-count, 2 continuous tomahawks, then the 'german' turn)
- Chopabout
- Phoenician Waltz (pps Roundabout, fully symmetrical)
- 726 Roundabout (psz + 1 manipulator, so a manipulation pattern on siteswap 
only Intercept and Carry, NO substitution)

# 4-person

- Kennedy (4-count roundabout with 2 manipulators, helicopter version)
- Scramble-V (learned the correct version!)
- Toast (scramble-V variation, easy to get, name comes 
	from manipulator literally jumping to catch feeder's pass)
- Scramble-3 (future request!)

# 5-person

- Scramble-3V (2-count 9-club feed runaround + 2 manipulators) - TODO!
