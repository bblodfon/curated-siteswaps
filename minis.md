## Clubs

Mostly **side-by-side**

### 4 clubs

- 42p11p  
  - '4' are all 'alone' (one in each juggler's hand)
  - 2p: get it up in the air and leave it to fall
  - 1p: give it to the hand of the other juggler that does a '4'
  - Variation: change the roles of the two hands in each juggler and 2p becomes a front plane flat quick throw
- 2p3p12  
  - '2p' is the same club and goes up and down
  - '3p' can be a front flat throw

### 5 clubs
