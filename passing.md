# NO MANIPULATION

## 2-person

### 3 clubs
- 720 (501-like)
- 522

### 4 clubs
- 552

### 5 clubs
- 1-count, psz (726)
- 41p31 (why not)
- Parsnip (ppzpz)

With zaps:
- 645
- 6662555
- 852 (heff, zip, zap)

### 6 clubs
- 4,3,2,1-count, pyramid variations - by count or by amount of passes in 
4-count as seen below:
  - psss = vanilla
  - ppss = chocolate bar
  - ppps = strawberry
  - pppp = banana (1-count :)
  
- Jim's 2,3-count  
To enter from normal 2,3-counts, one juggler throws a crossing pass
- p3p41 (why not) - a nice start: one juggler with 4 clubs
- pps, ppsps (bookends)

### 7 clubs
- 1-count (singles)
- 2-count (singles, doubles)
- 3-count (doubles. singles???)
- p3344 (5-count popcorn) - 78686
  - 53p3 (4-count popcorn) - 5 as double, single pass
- p34 (french 3-count) - 786
- 4pp3p (funky bookends) - 77786
- 88892 (nice with 441, but somewhat difficult)
- 9968926 (7 club why not - easier than it looks :)
- 7778686 (Vitoria)

# 3-person

## 9-clubs
- 2-count 9-club feed  
Var: Runaround (when the feeder changes - base pattern for Scramble-V)
- pps 9-club feed

- [Bruno's Nightmare](https://www.passingdb.com/patterns.php?id=49)  
A giant juggles 3 jugglers while they do 2-count feed runaround

## 10 clubs
- 2-count 10-club feed  
Var: Runaround (when the feeder changes - base pattern for Ample-V)
Feeder does a 2-count to the same person when the other juggler does the 
runaround part. The runaround can be: 3 slow selfs, 1 double self + 2 normal 
for example (you have to fill 5 bits of time in there :)

# 4-person

- Shooting star (single passes, one juggler runs to the extra corner of the 
pentagram)

- Y (2,4-count). Variations:
  - Rotating Y  
Always moving clockwise, both groups change position every n passes (2 or 3 
ususally), always pass and receive from the same juggler as before
  - Boxy-I Y (coolest variation of Y)  
US vs THEM, always moving clockwise, every n passes (2 or 3 usually) of 4-count 
ONLY one group changes position, at every moving one group (only) of jugglers 
changes the jugglers that they pass at, so generally you pass to both of the 
other group (but this is true only for one of the groups, the other does not 
change to whom they pass at). Each juggler in the group moves in a 
diamond-shaped path!

- Phantoms (nice and easy). Positioning:  
(Phantom) A B (Phantom)  
(Phantom) C D (Phantom)  
A pass to the phantom is  a pass to yourself! (or to some other person that 
might be coming there and fill in the 'phantom' position). Each juggler does 
a 2-count, windshield style. Example - D's throw sequence is: (Phantom), B, A, 
B, (Phantom), ...

- Weaver  
Feeder: 2-count and feeds like a windshield 3 people  
Feedes: 6-count and moving as a 3-people cascade

# 5-person

- Feast  
Pentagram positioning, 4-count.
Each time throw a pass to a different person's left hand (I mean do a 4-count 
with different person each time, following the circle orientation), find next 
person by going clockwise, start by throwing to the person on your left, could 
be vanilla, chocolate bar, banana and generally different kind of passes between 
each person (but have to be in a 4-count)

- Hand-feast (nice)  
Pentagram positioning, 4-count. 
Each time throw a pass to a different hand in the circle going clockwise,
when it is time to throw to your hands, 'throw' a self, feels like Jim's

# MANIPULATION

# 3-person

- 4-count Roundabout (standard)
- 3-count Roundabout (Nickie's version)
- Chopsticks (3-count, 2 continuous tomahawks, then the 'german' turn)
- Chopabout
- Phoenician Waltz (pps Roundabout, fully symmetrical)
- 726 Roundabout (psz + 1 manipulator, so a manipulation pattern on siteswap 
only Intercept and Carry, NO substitution)

# 4-person

- Kennedy (4-count roundabout with 2 manipulators, helicopter version)
- Scramble-V (learned the correct version!)
- Toast (scramble-V variation, easy to get, name comes 
	from manipulator literally jumping to catch feeder's pass)
- Scramble-3 (future request!)

# 5-person

- Scramble-3V (2-count 9-club feed runaround + 2 manipulators) - TODO!

# SIDE-BY-SIDE (MINIS)

## 4 clubs
- 42p11p  
'4' are all 'alone' (one in each juggler's hand)
2p: get it up in the air and leave it to fall
1p: give it to the hand of the other juggler that does a '4'
Variation: change the roles of the two hands in each juggler
2p becomes a front plane flat quick throw

- 2p3p12  
'2p' is the same club and goes up and down
'3p' can be a front half spin throw

## 5 clubs
- 413p2  
3p: front half flat from outside hand to inside hand of the other juggler,
can be chest tipping (filmed with Doreen)

- 332p2  
Second 3 as chest tip, 2p as 'reverse' chest tip, 2 reverse active high catch
(filmed with Doreen)

# Workshop for non-jugglers

## 2 people - 3 balls
- 311p1  
Face to Face pre-exercise: start with showing the one ball that is being 
passed and zipped - the other two are the 3's  
Side by side variation: the "inside" hands do the 3 and the 1p
- 311p3p  
face-to-face and side-by-side also nice
- 311p  
Cross vs straight passes

## 3 people - 5 balls

- 311p  
Every person sends the 1p straight to the person in his right (triangle 
positioning). 2 balls are the zips and 1p here.

## 1 person
- Table cascade
- Chin cascade
- Cascade together (holding each other backs - need for left-handed people)
- The road to 3 ball cascade
