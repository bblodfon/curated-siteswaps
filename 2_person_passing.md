# Non-manipulation patterns for 2 jugglers

### 3 clubs
- 720 (501-like)
- 522

### 4 clubs
- 552

### 5 clubs
- 1-count, psz (726)
- 41p31 (why not)
- Parsnip (ppzpz)

With zaps:
- 645
- 6662555
- 852 (heff, zip, zap)

### 6 clubs
- 4,3,2,1-count, pyramid variations - by count or by amount of passes in 
4-count as seen below:
  - psss = vanilla
  - ppss = chocolate bar
  - ppps = strawberry
  - pppp = banana (1-count :)
  
- Jim's 2,3-count  
To enter from normal 2,3-counts, one juggler throws a crossing pass
- p3p41 (why not) - a nice start: one juggler with 4 clubs
- pps, ppsps (bookends)

- 1-count (singles)
- 2-count (singles, doubles)
- 3-count (doubles. singles???)
- p3344 (5-count popcorn) - 78686
  - 53p3 (4-count popcorn) - 5 as double, single pass
- p34 (french 3-count) - 786
- 4pp3p (funky bookends) - 77786
- 88892 (nice with 441, but somewhat difficult)
- 9968926 (7 club why not - easier than it looks :)
