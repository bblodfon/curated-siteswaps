## 6-handed siteswaps {-#6-handed-siteswaps}

The only online document on 6-handed siteswaps I know is [this one](https://passing.zone/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-Person6-handed-Siteswaps.pdf).
With regard to the hand-order, the aforementioned document mentions the *standard* (Ar-Bl-Cr-Al-Br-Cl) and the *staggered* (Ar-Al-Br-Bl-Cr-Cl) sequence, where A,B,C are the jugglers, and r = right hand, l = left hand.
In most patterns listed below, we have tried both the standard and a new hand order (Ar-Br-Cr-Al-Bl-Cl, let's call it *all-rights-all-lefts*), which made more sense to me compared to the one called *staggered*.
In most cases (but not all!), the patterns got more irregular (harder passes) and less interesting when using different hand orders from the *standard* one.
So, in all patterns listed below, we will use the *standard* hand order, unless otherwise specified.
