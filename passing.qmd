## 6-handed siteswaps {-#6-handed-siteswaps}

The only online document on 6-handed siteswaps I know is [this one](https://passing.zone/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-Person6-handed-Siteswaps.pdf).
With regard to the hand-order, the aforementioned document mentions the *standard* (Ar-Bl-Cr-Al-Br-Cl) and the *staggered* (Ar-Al-Br-Bl-Cr-Cl) sequence, where A,B,C are the jugglers, and r = right hand, l = left hand.
In most patterns listed below, we have tried both the standard and a new hand order (Ar-Br-Cr-Al-Bl-Cl, let's call it *all-rights-all-lefts*), which made more sense to me compared to the one called *staggered*.
In most cases (but not all!), the patterns got more irregular (harder passes) and less interesting when using different hand orders from the *standard* one.
So, in all patterns listed below, we will use the *standard* hand order, unless otherwise specified.

### 8 clubs {-}

- **Mayday zap** - [a37979999](https://passist.org/siteswap/a37979999?jugglers=3), [video](https://youtu.be/LXSHpPcaVTU), every juggler does something different

- [ecd] - pps variation (**TO-TRY**)

## Feeds and Triangles {-#feeds}

In this section, "Feeds" and "Triangles" refer to patterns for **3 people**.
In feeding patterns, one person (the *feeder*) passes to the other two (the *feedees*).
The feedees don't pass to each other.

Useful notation:

- "F" => Feeder
- "LF" => Left-Feedee and "RF" => "Right-Feedee" refer to the two feedees/passers **as the feeder views them**
- "R" => starts right-handed, "L" => starts left-handed
- "||" => straight passes, "X" => cross passes

### 9 clubs {-}

## Many people patterns {-}

- **Bruno's Nightmare** (3-count version, 3 people)
  - A giant juggles 3 jugglers (2 do 6-count, one feeds in 3-count and they change
roles)
- **Why-not feed for 4+ people**
  - Feeders do why-not
  - People at the ends do 5-count popcorn or 5-club why-not
  - Two lines of people
  - One line starts, everyone there has 4 clubs
  - Other line responds, why-not jugglers have 2 clubs, 5-count popcorn start with 3 clubs
  - If starting side does *straight passes*, everyone can start right-handed.
- **Shooting star (4 people)**
  - 5 people, pentagram positioning
  - Idea is that one juggler runs to the extra corner of the pentagram when he/she rans out of clubs
  - Throw to the person that's right-next to the person that's right of you!
- **Y (4 people)** (2,3,4-count)
- **Weaver (4 people)**
  - Feeder: 2-count and feeds like a windshield 3 people
  - Feedees: 6-count and moving as a 3-people cascade
- **Feast (1-N people)**
  - Pass clockwise!
  - Hand-feast (nice variation, feels like Jim's)
- **Dropback Line**
  - 3 people: A,B vs C => A passes to C, C to B, B dropbacks to A
  - 4 people: A,B vs C,D => A passes to C, C dropbacks to D, D to B, B dropbacks to A
- **5-count Star with doubles (5 people, 16 clubs)**
  - Pentagram positioning, 5-count
  - Double passes
  - 16 clubs (one person holds 4 clubs and starts throwing in the 1st beat)
  - In each beat a different person throws a double (5 beats in total)
  - Throw **crossing passes** to the same person (the same person you would throw if you were doing a 4-count Star). Your right hand pass goes to his right hand, etc.

- 2p3p12  
  - '2p' is the same club and goes up and down
  - '3p' can be a front flat throw
