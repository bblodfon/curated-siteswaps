[["index.html", "Curated Siteswaps Intro Notes", " Curated Siteswaps John Zobolas Last updated: 15 April, 2023 Intro Knowledge acquired throughout years of practicing, playing over and over siteswaps, trying to find pleasant and/or aesthetic pattern characteristics through the siteswap numbering system. This is a collection of what feels good for me, without taking the difficulty to the extreme levels (e.g. 7 balls+). I also include specialized training regimes (again what worked for me best) and other miscellaneous stuff like mills mess and 3 ball patterns. Push forward and hard John Notes September 2022: Changed to GitBook using bookdown. November 2021: I found a better name for my collection of siteswaps: curated siteswaps! This name better encapsulates my effort to find the best ones and what best exactly means. Still an ongoing process! Also finally the 5 ball siteswaps have become more stable :) March 2021: I have started realizing that using different colored objects to juggle is a major improvement over the unicolor culture that I was familiar with. The use of colors benefits your technique, it’s more practical for learning new tricks, shows some hidden possibilities in your juggling exploiting a visual perspective, helps to build your own style and makes your mood better by adding an extra layer of diversity. So, I highly recommend it! Somewhere in 2020: After 10 years of Juggling, I understood this: it’s all about the form, siteswaps especially. Also, solidity of a siteswap/pattern seems to hold a different meaning for each person but given 2 jugglers with different solidity everybody agrees to who is more solid! Lastly, 7 still is too much (balls) and I really don’t find numbers above 7 worth pursuing anymore in siteswaps (form gets loose and unaesthetic). Found more meaning in 3 and 4 ball tricks, using imagination and of course club juggling that epitomizes that.

There are two chromaticities for the 55 throws: monochromatic 55 and dichromatic 55. We have 1 period per color when 55 is monochromatic and 4 periods when it is dichromatic - 2 as {blue,red} and 2 as {red,blue}. So after 2 periods, there is a color order change in the 55 dichromaticity case. Switch (monochromatic =&gt; dichromatic): 552 - 534 - 552 - see video The reverse transition (dichromatic =&gt; monochromatic) via a 534 must happen after the first 552 or after the first 552, but never during the change from {blue,red} to {red,blue}! I shall say that this transition happens at 1st or 3rd period of the global dichromatic 552. A siteswap that can be started from a dichromatic 552, after the 1st or 3rd period, and does not have transition throws, can be equivalently started from each hand holding two balls of the same color! This means that you can go from a dichromatic 552 after the 1st or 3rd global period, to a fountain pattern with different color balls in each respective hand! Start with monochromatic 552: 552 - 55613 - 63551 - see video Start with monochromatic 552: 552 - 55 |714 - see video (last sequence) Start with 1 color per hand: 642 - 63641 - 64613 - 5|561 - see video 1 (full sequence) and 2 (part of sequence) Start with 1 color per hand: 75251 - see video Start with dichromatic 552 and switch after 2nd or 4th period (*): 5|741 - see video (*): 5|6616162 - see video (*): 7427242 - see video (*): 5|8518501 - see video (*): 8441841481441 - see video (*): These are equivalent to starting from 4 ball fountain with throws corresponding to colors as (blue,red,red,blue). Note that the placement of the balls in your hands, so that the above throw sequence respects the coloring, forms a crossing pattern. 3+1 With red the one ball that does something completely different from the other 3! 55514 - 46451 - 63524 - 53444 - 534 - see video 55514 - 74414 - see video 55514 - 5|68141 - see video 55514 - 55|81461 - see video 55514 - 5|68501 - see video 534 - 5|75161 - see video 1-7 to 6716161 - see video 3 colors 1+1+2 45641 - see video 46451 - see video 1234567 + the 2 above all in one sequence - see video 7362514 (start from fountain with throws corresponding to colors as blue,red,red,green) - see video 75314 (start with 2 balls of the same color in one hand) - see video 5|58142 (start with 2 balls of the same color in one hand) - see video 4 colors 6372451 - see video Mills Mess Notation: R = Reverse (in time) F = Flipped Unless specified, each siteswap is done at all 3 positions: U (UP), M (MIDDLE), D (DOWN) 2 balls 312 (3xMM with active 2) 2 Var: wrist-up (MM, 3D), wrist-down (FMM, 3U) 3 balls Period 3 3 (MM,RMM,FMM,RFMM) 423, 441 (MM,FMM) 4D23 - Burke’s Barrage Twisted Burke’s Barrage - see video (3rd pattern) Twisted Takeouts - see video (4th pattern) 531 (MM), 5U3D1 (FMM) 51 + Var 4M-5D-0 Period 5 44403 (preparing for 4MM) 45141 52512 (baby juggling, the baby cries!) 53142, 34512, 52413 (magic sequences) 53403 (nice!) 63141, 2-colorable! 62313, 3-colorable!

Feedees: 3-count, crossing 6-handed siteswaps Experimental, tried: a37979999 4 jugglers Square placement, 2 jugglers work as 2-count feeders, the 2 others do 4-count as simple feedees Shooting star (single passes, one juggler runs to the extra corner of the pentagram when he rans out of clubs) Y (2-count mostly, can be 4-count). Variations: Rotating Y Always moving clockwise, both groups change position every n passes (2 or 3 usually), always pass and receive from the same juggler as before Boxy-I Y (coolest variation of Y) US vs THEM, always moving clockwise, every n passes (2 or 3 usually) of 4-count ONLY one group changes position, at every moving one group (only) of jugglers changes the jugglers that they pass at, so generally you pass to both of the other group (but this is true only for one of the groups, the other does not change to whom they pass at). Each juggler in the group moves in a diamond-shaped path! Weaver Feeder: 2-count and feeds like a windshield 3 people Feedees: 6-count and moving as a 3-people cascade 5 jugglers 2,3,4-count Star Pentagram positioning Throw to the person that’s right-next to the person that’s right of you! In 3-count, throws are outside Feast Pentagram positioning, 4-count Each time throw a pass to a different person’s left hand (I mean do a 4-count with different person each time, following the circle orientation) - find next person by going clockwise, start by throwing to the person on your left Throw sequence could be vanilla, chocolate bar, banana and generally different kind of passes between each person (but have to be in a 4-count) Hand-feast (nice) Pentagram positioning, 4-count Each time throw a pass to a different hand in the circle going clockwise, when it is time to throw to your hands, ‘throw’ a self, feels like Jim’s 5-count Star with doubles (and 16 clubs) Pentagram positioning, 5-count Double passes 16 clubs (one person holds 4 clubs and starts throwing in the 1st beat) In each beat a different person throws a double (5 beats in total) Throw crossing passes to the same person (the same person you would throw if you were doing a 4-count Star). Your right hand pass goes to his right hand, etc. Minis Clubs Mostly side-by-side 4 clubs 42p11p ‘4’ are all ‘alone’ (one in each juggler’s hand) 2p: get it up in the air and leave it to fall 1p: give it to the hand of the other juggler that does a ‘4’ Variation: change the roles of the two hands in each juggler and 2p becomes a front plane flat quick throw 2p3p12 ‘2p’ is the same club and goes up and down ‘3p’ can be a front flat throw 5 clubs 413p2 3p: front half flat from outside hand to inside hand of the other juggler, can be chest tipping (filmed with Doreen) 332p2 Second 3 as chest tip, 2p as ‘reverse’ chest tip, 2 reverse active high catch (filmed with Doreen) Balls Mostly face-to-face 3 Balls 1p (|| vs x) 311p (|| vs x) 3 person version - always straight passes to the person in your left 1.5p12 (423) 311p1 (||) 4 Balls 311p3p (||) 312 variations: 3p12,31p2,312p,…,3p1p2p!!! 5 Balls Partner Arm Weave Columns "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
