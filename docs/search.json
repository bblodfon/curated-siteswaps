    "text": "Preface\nKnowledge acquired throughout years of practicing, playing over and over with siteswaps, trying to find pleasant/aesthetic pattern characteristics using the siteswap notation system. This is a collection of what feels good for me, without taking the difficulty to the extreme levels (e.g. 7+ balls).\nI also include specialized training regimes (again what worked for me best) and other (miscellaneous) stuff like mills mess patterns, 3 ball tricks and a lot of passing patterns as well!\nJohn Zobolas"

    "text": "Notes\n\nJuly 2024: Changed notation for passing patterns, I feel I am closing on a curated list for 2 and 3 person passing.\nDecember 2023: Changed to Quarto.\nSeptember 2022: Changed to GitBook using bookdown.\nNovember 2021: I found a better name for my collection of siteswaps: curated siteswaps! This name better encapsulates my effort to find the best ones and what best exactly means. Still an ongoing process! Also finally the 5 ball siteswaps have become more stable :)\nMarch 2021: I have started realizing that using different colored objects to juggle is a major improvement over the unicolor culture that I was familiar with. The use of colors benefits your technique, it’s more practical for learning new tricks, shows some hidden possibilities in your juggling exploiting a visual perspective, helps to build your own style and makes your mood better by adding an extra layer of diversity. So, I highly recommend it!\nSomewhere in 2020: After 10 years of Juggling, I understood this: it’s all about the form, siteswaps especially. Also, solidity of a siteswap/pattern seems to hold a different meaning for each person but given 2 jugglers with different solidity everybody agrees to who is more solid! Lastly, 7 still is too much (balls) and I really don’t find numbers above 7 worth pursuing anymore in siteswaps (form gets loose and unaesthetic). Found more meaning in 3 and 4 ball tricks, using imagination and of course club juggling that epitomizes that."

    "section": "4 Ball Colored Patterns",
    "text": "4 Ball Colored Patterns\nMy favorite 4 ball colored siteswaps :)\nThe most interesting patterns (visually) have 2 or 3 colors.\n\n2 colors\n\n2+2\n\nBase pattern is 552. There are two chromaticities for the 55 throws: monochromatic 55 and dichromatic 55. We have 1 period per color when 55 is monochromatic and 4 periods when it is dichromatic - 2 as {blue,red} and 2 as {red,blue}. So after 2 periods, there is a color order change in the 55 dichromaticity case.\nSwitch (monochromatic =&gt; dichromatic): 552 - 534 - 552 - see video\n\nThe reverse transition (dichromatic =&gt; monochromatic) via a 534 must happen after the first 552 or after the first 552, but never during the change from {blue,red} to {red,blue}! I shall say that this transition happens at 1st or 3rd period of the global dichromatic 552.\nA siteswap that can be started from a dichromatic 552, after the 1st or 3rd period, and does not have transition throws, can be equivalently started from each hand holding two balls of the same color! This means that you can go from a dichromatic 552 after the 1st or 3rd global period, to a fountain pattern with different color balls in each respective hand!\n\nStart with monochromatic 552: 552 - 55613 - 63551 - see video\nStart with monochromatic 552: 552 - 55 |714 - see video (last sequence)\nStart with 1 color per hand: 642 - 63641 - 64613 - 5|561 - see video 1 (full sequence) and 2 (part of sequence)\nStart with 1 color per hand: 75251 - see video\nStart with dichromatic 552 and switch after 2nd or 4th period (*): 5|741 - see video\n(*): 5|6616162 - see video\n(*): 7427242 - see video\n(*): 5|8518501 - see video\n(*): 8441841481441 - see video\n\n(*): These are equivalent to starting from 4 ball fountain with throws corresponding to colors as (blue,red,red,blue). Note that the placement of the balls in your hands, so that the above throw sequence respects the coloring, forms a crossing pattern.\n\n\n3+1\nWith red the one ball that does something completely different from the other 3!\n\n55514 - 46451 - 63524 - 53444 - 534 - see video\n55514 - 74414 - see video\n55514 - 5|68141 - see video\n55514 - 55|81461 - see video\n55514 - 5|68501 - see video\n534 - 5|75161 - see video\n1-7 to 6716161 - see video\n\n\n\n\n3 colors\n\n1+1+2\n\n45641 - see video\n46451 - see video\n1234567 + the 2 above all in one sequence - see video\n7362514 (start from fountain with throws corresponding to colors as blue,red,red,green) - see video\n75314 (start with 2 balls of the same color in one hand) - see video\n5|58142 (start with 2 balls of the same color in one hand) - see video\n\n\n\n\n4 colors\n\n6372451 - see video"

In most patterns listed below, we have tried both the standard and a new hand order (Ar-Br-Cr-Al-Bl-Cl, let’s call it all-rights-all-lefts), which made more sense to me compared to the one called staggered.
